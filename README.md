# Heavy-Duty-Carrier-With-Collision-Avoidance

This project"Heavy duty carrier with line following" which consist of three main functions :  
Autonomous navigation which is done by the LIDAR.
Line following done which is done using image processing.
And also it had a web interface to get the live feed from the camera.
    
ROS platform was used to simulate the autonomous navigation and line following functions of our robot. 

This resporsitory consists of the workspace created for the simulation done in ROS and the code that was used to get the live feed from the camera.
